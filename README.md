# Tensorboard
This is a wrapper class for the Tensorflow's Tensorboard application. It is still in early development, and should be used with a grain of salt.
If you want to help be sure to contact me or fork this repository and work on our ToDo list from the development branch.
Tensorboard.py is the Wrapper that contains all functions needed to interact, more documentation should come in the future, but as for now, the requirements for this project are:

```
setuptools
wheel
twine
numpy
tensorboard==1.15
torch>=1.6.0 
torchvision>=0.7.0 
```

You can now install this project by using:
```{bash}
pip install tensorboard-wrapper
```

You can run the tests by executing:
```{bash}
python -m unittest test.py
```

### And the list of the functions already implemented:
